Keylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, with many different ways of intercepting keystrokes, but other methods exist to target information for specific purposes, such as performing a UAC prompt or wrapping the Windows default credential provider. 
Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when Credential Dumping efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to remain passive on a system for a period of time before an opportunity arises.
Adversaries may also install code on externally facing portals, such as a VPN login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service.

The Windows security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identifies a user or group account. SIDs are used by Windows security in both security descriptors and access tokens. An account can hold additional SIDs in the SID-History Active Directory attribute, allowing inter-operable account migration between domains (e.g., all values in SID-History are included in access tokens).
Adversaries may use this mechanism for privilege escalation. With Domain Administrator (or equivalent) rights, harvested or well-known SID values may be inserted into SID-History to enable impersonation of arbitrary users/groups such as Enterprise Administrators.

This reference set is a list of binary names of network packet capturing software. The reference set has been pre-populated with names of some common network protocol analysis software filenames.

Background:
   Packet capturing programs can allow a user to capture and examine traffic on a network. If these programs don't have adequate internal access controls, users may use them to learn information they might otherwise not have access to.

   In addition, these programs sometimes carry a risk of exploitation.

    IBM Trusted References :

        https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/search/netmon
        https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/search/wireshark

    Third Party References :
        http://sectools.org/tag/sniffers/?sort=release

Remedy :
    Examine the addresses and users involved. Ensure those systems are authorized to engage in packet capturing for administrative purposes.

    Refer to packet capture program's vendor documentation for patch, upgrade or suggested workaround information to mitigate any known vulnerabilities.

Detection notes and modification:
    The scope of this rule can be modified by adding or removing binary names for packet capturing tools to ""UBA : Network Capture, Monitoring and Analysis Program Filenames""

    The reference set has been pre-populated with the following values:

        'wireshark.exe'
        'dumpcap.exe'
        'tshark.exe'
        'netmon.exe'
        'messageanalyzer.exe'
        'windump.exe'
        'nmap.exe'

    Example: To add detection for WinDump.exe, add the value 'windump.exe'  to the reference set 'UBA : Network Capture, Monitoring and Analysis Program Filenames' [Note - Do not include the quotes. For full details please see Qradar SIEM administration documentation topics 'Reference sets management' -and- 'Adding an element to a reference set' topics. ]

    The reference set ""UBA : Network Capture, Monitoring and Analysis Program Filenames"" is not case sensitive. 'netmon.exe' is equivalent to 'NetMon.exe'.
