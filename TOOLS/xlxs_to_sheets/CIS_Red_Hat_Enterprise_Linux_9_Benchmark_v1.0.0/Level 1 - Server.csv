1.1,,Filesystem Configuration,,"Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for system operations.

The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be performed before repartitioning the system.

**Note:** If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise, it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data to the `/tmp` directory, this data will still consume space in `/` once the `/tmp` filesystem is mounted unless it is removed first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An inventory of such devices should be maintained.;",10.3,,,X,X,X,13.7,,,,X,X,
1.1.1,,Disable unused filesystems,,"A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, especially in light of frequent operating system changes.

Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less attractive.

**Note**: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of filesystems. You may wish to consider additions to those listed here for your environment. For the current available file system modules on the system see `/usr/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/fs`

#### Startup scripts

Kernel modules loaded directly via `insmod` will ignore what is configured in the relevant `/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf` files. If modules are still being loaded after a reboot whilst having the correctly configured `blacklist` and `install` command, check for `insmod` entries in startup scripts such as `.bashrc`.

You may also want to check `/usr/lib/modprobe.d/`. Please note that this directory should not be used for user defined module loading. Ensure that all such entries reside in `/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf` files.

#### Return values

By using `/bin/false` as the command in disabling a particular module service two purposes; to convey the meaning of the entry to the user and cause a non-zero return value. The latter can be tested for in scripts. Please note that `insmod` will ignore what is configured in the relevant `/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf` files. The preferred way to load modules is with `modprobe`.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.1.2,,Configure /tmp,,The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.1.2,1.1.2.1,Ensure /tmp is a separate partition,Automated,The `/tmp` directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications.,"Making `/tmp` its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the `noexec` option on the mount, making `/tmp` useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system `setuid` program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.

Since the `/tmp` directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.

This can be accomplished by either mounting `tmpfs` to `/tmp`, or creating a separate partition for `/tmp`.","By design files saved to `/tmp` should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system. `tmpfs` is ram based and all files stored to `tmpfs` will be lost when the system is rebooted.

If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to `/var/tmp` not `/tmp`.

Running out of `/tmp` space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where `/tmp` is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single `/` partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based `/tmp` (as with `tmpfs`) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for `/tmp` from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than `tmpfs` which is RAM-based.","First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that `/tmp` will be mounted at boot time.

```
# systemctl unmask tmp.mount
```

For specific configuration requirements of the `/tmp` mount for your environment, modify `/etc/fstab`.

Example of using `tmpfs` with specific mount options:

```
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 0
```

Example of using a volume or disk with specific mount options. The source location of the volume or disk will vary depending on your environment.

```
<device> /tmp <fstype> defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0
```","Run the following command and verify the output shows that `/tmp` is mounted. Particular requirements pertaining to mount options are covered in ensuing sections.

```
# findmnt --kernel /tmp

TARGET SOURCE FSTYPE OPTIONS
/tmp tmpfs tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,seclabel
```

Ensure that systemd will mount the `/tmp` partition at boot time.

```
# systemctl is-enabled tmp.mount

static
```

**Note:** By default systemd will output `generated` if there is an entry in `/etc/fstab` for `/tmp`. This just means systemd will use the entry in `/etc/fstab` instead of its default unit file configuration for `/tmp`.","If an entry for `/tmp` exists in `/etc/fstab` it will take precedence over entries in systemd default unit file located at `/usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mount`.

`/tmp` utilizing `tmpfs` can be resized using the `size={size}` parameter in the relevant entry in `/etc/fstab`.

Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program.

#### List installed GPG keys

Run the following command to list the currently installed keys. These are the active keys used for verification and installation of RPMs. The packages are fake, they are generated on the fly by `dnf` or `rpm` during the import of keys from the URL specified in the repository configuration.

Example:

```
# for RPM_PACKAGE in $(rpm -q gpg-pubkey); do
 echo ""RPM: ${RPM_PACKAGE}""
 RPM_SUMMARY=$(rpm -q --queryformat ""%{SUMMARY}"" ""${RPM_PACKAGE}"")
 RPM_PACKAGER=$(rpm -q --queryformat ""%{PACKAGER}"" ""${RPM_PACKAGE}"")
 RPM_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d -d ""1970-1-1+$((0x$(rpm -q --queryformat ""%{RELEASE}"" ""${RPM_PACKAGE}"") ))sec"")
 RPM_KEY_ID=$(rpm -q --queryformat ""%{VERSION}"" ""${RPM_PACKAGE}"")
 echo ""Packager: ${RPM_PACKAGER}
Summary: ${RPM_SUMMARY}
Creation date: ${RPM_DATE}
Key ID: ${RPM_KEY_ID}
""
done

RPM: gpg-pubkey-9db62fb1-59920156
Packager: Fedora 28 (28) <fedora-28@fedoraproject.org>
Summary: gpg(Fedora 28 (28) <fedora-28@fedoraproject.org>)
Creation date: 2017-08-14
Key ID: 9db62fb1

RPM: gpg-pubkey-09eab3f2-595fbba3
Packager: RPM Fusion free repository for Fedora (28) <rpmfusion-buildsys@lists.rpmfusion.org>
Summary: gpg(RPM Fusion free repository for Fedora (28) <rpmfusion-buildsys@lists.rpmfusion.org>)
Creation date: 2017-07-07
Key ID: 09eab3f2
```

The format of the package (`gpg-pubkey-9db62fb1-59920156`) is important to understand for verification. Using the above example, it consists of three parts:
1. The general prefix name for all imported GPG keys: `gpg-pubkey-`
2. The version, which is the GPG key ID: `9db62fb1`
3. The release is the date of the key in UNIX timestamp in hexadecimal: `59920156`

With both the date and the GPG key ID, check the relevant repositories public key page to confirm that the keys are indeed correct.

#### Query locally available GPG keys

Repositories that store their respective GPG keys on disk should do so in `/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/`. These keys are available for immediate import either when `dnf` is asked to install a relevant package from the repository or when an administrator imports the key directly with the `rpm --import` command.

To find where these keys come from run:

```
# for PACKAGE in $(find /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ -type f -exec rpm -qf {} \; | sort -u); do rpm -q --queryformat ""%{NAME}-%{VERSION} %{PACKAGER} %{SUMMARY}\\n"" ""${PACKAGE}""; done

1.4,,Secure Boot Settings,,"The recommendations in this section focus on securing the bootloader and settings involved in the boot process directly.

**Note:** 
- In Fedora 28 based distributions, the kernel command-line parameters for systems using the GRUB2 bootloader were defined in the `kernelopts` environment variable. This variable was stored in the `/boot/grub2/grubenv` file for each kernel boot entry. However, storing the kernel command-line parameters using `kernelopts` was not robust. Therefore, the `kernelopts` has been removed and the kernel command-line parameters are now stored in the Boot Loader Specification (BLS) snippet, instead of in the `/boot/loader/entries/<KERNEL_BOOT_ENTRY>.conf` file.
- Boot loader configuration files are unified across CPU architectures
 - Configuration files for the GRUB boot loader are now stored in the `/boot/grub2/` directory on all supported CPU architectures. The `/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg` file, which GRUB previously used as the main configuration file on UEFI systems, now simply loads the `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` file.
 - This change simplifies the layout of the GRUB configuration file, improves user experience, and provides the following notable benefits:
 - You can boot the same installation with either EFI or legacy BIOS.
 - You can use the same documentation and commands for all architectures.
 - GRUB configuration tools are more robust, because they no longer rely on symbolic links and they do not have to handle platform-specific cases.
 - The usage of the GRUB configuration files is aligned with images generated by CoreOS Assembler (COSA) and OSBuild.
 - The usage of the GRUB configuration files is aligned with other Linux distributions.
 - Fedora 34 based distributions no longer boot on 32-bit UEFI
- Support for the 32-bit UEFI firmware was removed from the GRUB and shim boot loaders. As a consequence, Fedora 34 based distributions requires a 64-bit UEFI, and can no longer boot on 64-bit systems that use a 32-bit UEFI.
 - The following packages have been removed as part of this change:
 - `grub2-efi-ia32`
 - `grub2-efi-ia32-cdboot`
 - `grub2-efi-ia32-modules`
 - `shim-ia32`

Holding the SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or other means to fix the problem","Create an encrypted password with `grub2-setpassword`:

1.6,,Mandatory Access Control,,"Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provides an additional layer of access restrictions to processes on top of the base Discretionary Access Controls. By restricting how processes can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the processes can be reduced.

**Impact:** Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.6.1,,Configure SELinux,,"SELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Every process and system resource has a special security label called an SELinux context. A SELinux context, sometimes referred to as an SELinux label, is an identifier which abstracts away the system-level details and focuses on the security properties of the entity. Not only does this provide a consistent way of referencing objects in the SELinux policy, but it also removes any ambiguity that can be found in other identification methods. For example, a file can have multiple valid path names on a system that makes use of bind mounts. 

The SELinux policy uses these contexts in a series of rules which define how processes can interact with each other and the various system resources. By default, the policy does not allow any interaction unless a rule explicitly grants access. 

In Fedora 34 Family Linux distributions, system services are controlled by the systemd daemon; systemd starts and stops all services, and users and processes communicate with systemd using the systemctl utility. The systemd daemon can consult the SELinux policy and check the label of the calling process and the label of the unit file that the caller tries to manage, and then ask SELinux whether or not the caller is allowed the access. This approach strengthens access control to critical system capabilities, which include starting and stopping system services.

This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation. Two such policies have been designed for use with Fedora 34 Family Linux distributions and are included with the system: `targeted` and `mls`. These are described as follows:

- `targeted`: targeted processes run in their own domain, called a confined domain. In a confined domain, the files that a targeted process has access to are limited. If a confined process is compromised by an attacker, the attacker’s access to resources and the possible damage they can do is also limited. SELinux denies access to these resources and logs the denial.
- `mls`: implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these.

This section provides guidance for the configuration of the `targeted` policy.

**Notes:** 

- Remember that SELinux policy rules are checked after DAC rules. SELinux policy rules are not used if DAC rules deny access first, which means that no SELinux denial is logged if the traditional DAC rules prevent the access.
- This section only applies if SELinux is in use on the system. Additional Mandatory Access Control systems exist.
- To avoid incorrect SELinux labeling and subsequent problems, ensure that you start services using a systemctl start command.

`grubby` is a command line tool for updating and displaying information about the configuration files for the grub2 and zipl boot loaders. It is primarily designed to be used from scripts which install new kernels and need to find information about the current boot environment.
- All bootloaders define the boot entries as individual configuration fragments that are stored by default in `/boot/loader/entries`. The format for the config files is specified at https://systemd.io/BOOT_LOADER_SPECIFICATION. The grubby tool is used to update and display the configuration defined in the `BootLoaderSpec` fragment files.
- There are a number of ways to specify the kernel used for --info, --remove-kernel, and --update-kernel. Specifying DEFAULT or ALL selects the de‐fault entry and all of the entries, respectively. Also, the title of a boot entry may be specified by using TITLE=title as the argument; all entries with that title are used.","TITLE:Configure Data Access Control Lists CONTROL:v8 3.3 DESCRIPTION:Configure data access control lists based on a user’s need to know.

1.6.1,1.6.1.4,Ensure the SELinux mode is not disabled,Automated,"SELinux can run in one of three modes: disabled, permissive, or enforcing:
- Enforcing - Is the default, and recommended, mode of operation; in enforcing mode SELinux operates normally, enforcing the loaded security policy on the entire system.
- Permissive - The system acts as if SELinux is enforcing the loaded security policy, including labeling objects and emitting access denial entries in the logs, but it does not actually deny any operations. While not recommended for production systems, permissive mode can be helpful for SELinux policy development.
- Disabled - Is strongly discouraged; not only does the system avoid enforcing the SELinux policy, it also avoids labeling any persistent objects such as files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future

**Note:** you can set individual domains to permissive mode while the system runs in enforcing mode. For example, to make the httpd_t domain permissive:

```
# semanage permissive -a httpd_t
```","Running SELinux in disabled mode is strongly discouraged; not only does the system avoid enforcing the SELinux policy, it also avoids labeling any persistent objects such as files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future.",,"Run one of the following commands to set SELinux's running mode:

1.8,1.8.7,Ensure GDM disabling automatic mounting of removable media is not overridden,Automated,"By default GNOME automatically mounts removable media when inserted as a convenience to the user

By using the lockdown mode in dconf, you can prevent users from changing specific settings.

To lock down a dconf key or subpath, create a locks subdirectory in the keyfile directory. The files inside this directory contain a list of keys or subpaths to lock. Just as with the keyfiles, you may add any number of files to this directory.

_Example Lock File:_
```
# Lock automount settings
/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automount
/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automount-open
```",With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a USB drive or disc and have its contents available in system even if they lacked permissions to mount it themselves.,The use of portable hard drives is very common for workstation users,"Run the following script to lock disable automatic mounting of media for all GNOME users:

In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used.","Setting `net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route`, `net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route`, `net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route` and `net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route` to `0` disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing.",,"Set the following parameters in `/etc/sysctl.conf` or a `/etc/sysctl.d/*` file:

3.4,,Configure Host Based Firewall,,"A Host Based Firewall, on a Linux system, is a set of rules. When a data packet moves into or out of a protected network space, its contents (in particular, information about its origin, target, and the protocol it plans to use) are tested against the firewall rules to see if it should be allowed through

To provide a Host Based Firewall, the Linux kernel includes support for nftables.
 - nftables - A subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames. nftables is supposed to replace certain parts of Netfilter, while keeping and reusing most of it. nftables utilizes the building blocks of the Netfilter infrastructure, such as the existing hooks into the networking stack, connection tracking system, userspace queueing component, and logging subsystem.

In order to configure firewall rules for nftables, a firewall utility needs to be installed. Guidance has been included for the following firewall utilities:
 - FirewallD - Provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables backend. Starting in v0.6.0, FirewallD added support for acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables userspace utility, acting as an alternative to the nft command line program. firewalld supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can administer separate firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles. 
 - nftables - Includes the nft utility for configuration of the nftables subsystem of the Linux kernel

**Note:**
- Only **one** method should be used to configure a firewall on the system. Use of more than one method could produce unexpected results.
- This section is intended only to ensure the resulting firewall rules are in place, not how they are configured.
- The `ipset` and `iptables-nft` packages have been deprecated in Fedora 34 based Linux distributions. This includes deprecation of nft-variants such as `iptables`, `ip6tables`, `arptables`, and `ebtables` utilities. If you are using any of these tools, for example, because you upgraded from an earlier version, we recommend migrating to the nft command line tool provided by the nftables package.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 - Use the firewalld utility for simple firewall use cases. The utility is easy to use and covers the typical use cases for these scenarios.
- NFTables:
 - Includes the nft utility for configuration of the nftables subsystem of the Linux kernel
 - Use the nftables utility to set up complex and performance critical firewalls, such as for a whole network.

**Note:**
- Only **one** method should be used to configure a firewall on the system. Use of more than one method could produce unexpected results.
- IPTables are deprecated in this release, and not covered in this Benchmark. The iptables utility on Fedora 34/CentOS 9 stream based Linux distributions uses the nf_tables kernel API instead of the legacy back end. The nf_tables API provides backward compatibility so that scripts that use iptables commands still work on Fedora 34 based Linux distributions.

3.4.2,,Configure firewall rules,,"nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames and is the successor to iptables.

**Important:** Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested before saving to boot.

**FirewallD**

The following will create a FirewallD Zone called `securezone` to implement the firewall rules of this section leveraging the firewalld utility included with the firewalld package. This example will open port 22(ssh) from anywhere. Opening service `SSH` should be updated in accordance with local site policy.

_Sample securezone zone xml file_

```
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<zone target=""DROP"">

 <source address=""::1""/>
 <destination address=""::1"" invert=""True""/>
 <drop/>
 </rule>
 <icmp-block-inversion/>

```

**Note:** To use this zone, save this as `/etc/firewalld/zones/securezone.xml` and run the following commands:

```
# firewall-cmd --reload
# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=securezone --change-interface={NAME OF NETWORK INTERFACE}
```

**NFTables Utility:**

The following will implement the firewall rules of this section leveraging the nftables utility included with the nftables package. This example will open ICMP, IGMP, and port 22(ssh) from anywhere. Opening the ports for ICMP, IGMP, and port 22(ssh) needs to be updated in accordance with local site policy. Allow port 22(ssh) should to be updated to only allow systems requiring ssh connectivity to connect, as per site policy.

Save the script below as `/etc/nftables/nftables.rules` 
```
# This nftables.rules config should be saved as /etc/nftables/nftables.rules

# flush nftables rulesset
flush ruleset

# Load nftables ruleset
# nftables config with inet table named filter

table inet filter {
 chain input {
 type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop;

 # early drop invalid packets
 ct state invalid drop

 # allow loopback if not forged

 iif != lo ip6 daddr ::1/128 drop

 # allow connections made by ourselves

 # allow from anywhere

 icmp type { destination-unreachable, router-advertisement, router-solicitation, time-exceeded, parameter-problem } accept
 }

 chain forward {
 # drop all forward
 type filter hook forward priority 0; policy drop;
 }

 chain output {
 # can omit this as its accept by default
 type filter hook output priority 0; policy accept;
 }
}
```

Run the following command to load the file into nftables
```
# nft -f /etc/nftables/nftables.rules
```

**Note:** All changes in the nftables subsections are temporary

To make these changes permanent:

Run the following command to create the nftables.rules file

3.4.2,3.4.2.1,Ensure firewalld default zone is set,Automated,"A firewall zone defines the trust level for a connection, interface or source address binding. This is a one to many relation, which means that a connection, interface or source can only be part of one zone, but a zone can be used for many network connections, interfaces and sources.
- The default zone is the zone that is used for everything that is not explicitly bound/assigned to another zone.
- If no zone assigned to a connection, interface or source, only the default zone is used. 
- The default zone is not always listed as being used for an interface or source as it will be used for it either way. This depends on the manager of the interfaces.

Connections handled by NetworkManager are listed as NetworkManager requests to add the zone binding for the interface used by the connection. Also interfaces under control of the network service are listed also because the service requests it.

**Note:**
- A firewalld zone configuration file contains the information for a zone.
 - These are the zone description, services, ports, protocols, icmp-blocks, masquerade, forward-ports and rich language rules in an XML file format.
 - The file name has to be `zone_name.xml` where length of `zone_name` is currently limited to 17 chars.

Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.

Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. Reference <[http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/](http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/)> manual page for more information on configuring chrony.

It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log.

**Note on log file permissions:** There really isn't a ""one size fits all"" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as ""wheel"" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (`root:root 600`). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as `root:securegrp 640 `where `securegrp` is the defined security group (in some cases `wheel`).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,4.3,Ensure logrotate is configured,Manual,The system includes the capability of rotating log files regularly to avoid filling up the system with logs or making the logs unmanageably large. The file `/etc/logrotate.d/syslog` is the configuration file used to rotate log files created by `syslog` or `rsyslog`.,"By keeping the log files smaller and more manageable, a system administrator can easily archive these files to another system and spend less time looking through inordinately large log files.",,Edit `/etc/logrotate.conf` and `/etc/logrotate.d/*` to ensure logs are rotated according to site policy.,Review `/etc/logrotate.conf` and `/etc/logrotate.d/*` and verify logs are rotated according to site policy.,"If no `maxage` setting is set for `logrotate` a situation can occur where `logrotate` is interrupted and fails to delete rotated log files. It is recommended to set this to a value greater than the longest any log file should exist on your system to ensure that any such log file is removed but standard rotation settings are not overridden.

4.1,,Configure System Accounting (auditd),,"The Linux Auditing System operates on a set of rules that collects certain types of system activity to facilitate incident investigation, detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default events will be logged to `/var/log/audit/audit.log`, which can be configured in `/etc/audit/auditd.conf`.

The following types of audit rules can be specified:
 - Control rules: Configuration of the auditing system.
 - File system rules: Allow the auditing of access to a particular file or a directory. Also known as file watches.
 - System call rules: Allow logging of system calls that any specified program makes.

Audit rules can be set:
 - On the command line using the `auditctl` utility. These rules are not persistent across reboots.
 - In `/etc/audit/audit.rules`. These rules have to be merged and loaded before they are active.

**Notes:**
 - For 64 bit systems that have `arch` as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems calls. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.
 - If the auditing system is configured to be locked (`-e 2`), a system reboot will be required in order to load any changes.
 - Key names are optional on the rules and will not be used in compliance auditing. The usage of key names is highly recommended as it facilitates organization and searching; as such, all remediation steps will have key names supplied.
 - It is best practice to store the rules, in number prepended files, in `/etc/audit/rules.d/`. Rules must end in a `.rules` suffix. This then requires the use of `augenrules` to merge all the rules into `/etc/audit/audit.rules` based on their alphabetical (lexical) sort order. All benchmark recommendations follow this best practice for remediation, specifically using the prefix of `50` which is center weighed if all rule sets make use of the number prepending naming convention.
 - Your system may have been customized to change the default `UID_MIN`. All sample output uses `1000`, but this value will not be used in compliance auditing. To confirm the `UID_MIN` for your system, run the following command: `awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs`

#### Normalization
The Audit system normalizes some entries, so when you look at the sample output keep in mind that:
 - With regards to users whose login UID is not set, the values `-1` / `unset` / `4294967295` are equivalent and normalized to `-1`.
 - When comparing field types and both sides of the comparison is valid fields types, such as `euid!=uid`, then the auditing system may normalize such that the output is `uid!=euid`.
 - Some parts of the rule may be rearranged whilst others are dependent on previous syntax. For example, the following two statements are the same:

```
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F auid!=-1 -F key=user_emulation
```

and

```
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -S execve -k user_emulation
```

#### Capacity planning

The recommendations in this section implement auditing policies that not only produce large quantities of logged data, but may also negatively impact system performance. Capacity planning is critical in order not to adversely impact production environments.

 - Disk space. If a significantly large set of events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated. If the logs are not sent to a remote log server, ensure that log rotation is implemented else the disk will fill up and the system will halt. Even when logs are sent to a log server, ensure sufficient disk space to allow caching of logs in the case of temporary network outages.
 - Disk IO. It is not just the amount of data collected that should be considered, but the rate at which logs are generated.
 - CPU overhead. System call rules might incur considerable CPU overhead. Test the systems open/close syscalls per second with and without the rules to gauge the impact of the rules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.1.1,,Ensure auditing is enabled,,The capturing of system events provides system administrators with information to allow them to determine if unauthorized access to their system is occurring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.1.2,,Configure Data Retention,,"When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them. Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.1.3,,Configure auditd rules,,"The Audit system operates on a set of rules that define what is to be captured in the log files.

The following types of Audit rules can be specified:
 - Control rules: Allow the Audit system's behavior and some of its configuration to be modified.
 - File system rules: Allow the auditing of access to a particular file or a directory. (Also known as file watches)
 - System call rules: Allow logging of system calls that any specified program makes.

Audit rules can be set:
 - on the command line using the auditctl utility. Note that these rules are not persistent across reboots.
 - in a file ending in `.rules` in the `/etc/audit/audit.d/` directory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.1.4,,Configure auditd file access,,"Without the capability to restrict which roles and individuals can select which events are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent the auditing of critical events.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.2,,Configure Logging,,"Logging services should be configured to prevent information leaks and to aggregate logs on a remote server so that they can be reviewed in the event of a system compromise. A centralized log server provides a single point of entry for further analysis, monitoring and filtering.

### Security principals for logging
* Ensure transport layer security is implemented between the client and the log server.
* Ensure that logs are rotated as per the environment requirements.
* Ensure all locally generated logs have the appropriate permissions.
* Ensure all security logs are sent to a remote log server.
* Ensure the required events are logged.

### What is covered
This section will cover the minimum best practices for the usage of **either** `rsyslog` **or** `journald`. The recommendations are written such that each is wholly independent of each other and **only one is implemented**.
* If your organization makes use of an enterprise wide logging system completely outside of `rsyslog` or `journald`, then the following recommendations does not directly apply. However, the principals of the recommendations should be followed regardless of what solution is implemented. If the enterprise solution incorporates either of these tools, careful consideration should be given to the following recommendations to determine exactly what applies.
* Should your organization make use of both `rsyslog` and `journald`, take care how the recommendations may or may not apply to you.

### What is not covered
* Enterprise logging systems not utilizing `rsyslog` or `journald`.
As logging is very situational and dependent on the local environment, not everything can be covered here.
* Transport layer security should be applied to all remote logging functionality. Both `rsyslog` and `journald` supports secure transport and should be configured as such.
* The log server. There are a multitude of reasons for a centralized log server (and keeping a short period logging on the local system), but the log server is out of scope for these recommendations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.2,4.2.3,Ensure all logfiles have appropriate permissions and ownership,Automated,"Log files contain information from many services on the local system, or in the event of a centralized log server, others system’s logs as well. In general log files are found in `/var/log/`, although application can be configured to store logs elsewhere. Should your application store its logs in another location, ensure to run the same test on that location.",It is important that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive data is protected and that only the appropriate users / groups have access to them.,,"Run the following script to update permissions and ownership on files in `/var/log`. 

Although the script is not destructive, ensure that the output of the audit procedure is captured in the event that the remediation causes issues.

5.2,5.2.20,Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured,Automated,"**NOTE:** To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not, and never had, intentionally the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before `8.2p1` there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in `8.2p1` and thus may no longer be abused disconnect idle users.

The two options `ClientAliveInterval` and `ClientAliveCountMax` control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from `man 5 sshd_config`:

- `ClientAliveInterval` Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.

- `ClientAliveCountMax` Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.
The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.","In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both `ClientAliveInterval` and `ClientAliveCountMax`. Specifically, looking at the source code, `ClientAliveCountMax` must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks.

The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate.",,"Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to set the parameters according to site policy. 

Example:

```
ClientAliveInterval 15
ClientAliveCountMax 3
```","Run the following commands and verify `ClientAliveInterval` is greater than zero:

```
# sshd -T -C user=root -C host=""$(hostname)"" -C addr=""$(grep $(hostname) /etc/hosts | awk '{print $1}')"" | grep clientaliveinterval

5.4,,Configure authselect,,"Authselect is a utility that simplifies the configuration of user authentication. Authselect offers two ready-made profiles that can be universally used with all modern identity management systems

Authselect makes testing and troubleshooting easy because it only modifies files in these directories:

- `/etc/nsswitch.conf`
- `/etc/pam.d/* files`
- `/etc/dconf/db/distro.d/* files`

You can create and deploy a custom profile by customizing one of the default profiles, the sssd, winbind, or the nis profile. This is particularly useful if Modifying a ready-made authselect profile is not enough for your needs. When you deploy a custom profile, the profile is applied to every user logging into the given host. This would be the recommended method, so that the existing profiles can remain unmodified.

_Example of creating a custom authselect profile called custom-profile_

```
# authselect create-profile custom-profile -b sssd --symlink-meta
```

**WARNING:** 

Do not use authselect if: 
- your host is part of Linux Identity Management. Joining your host to an IdM domain with the ipa-client-install command automatically configures SSSD authentication on your host.
- Your host is part of Active Directory via SSSD. Calling the realm join command to join your host to an Active Directory domain automatically configures SSSD authentication on your host.
- It is not recommended to change the authselect profiles configured by ipa-client-install or realm join. If you need to modify them, display the current settings before making any modifications, so you can revert back to them if necessary",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5.6,5.6.5,Ensure default user umask is 027 or more restrictive,Automated,"The user file-creation mode mask (`umask`) is use to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (`rwxrwxrwx`), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (`rw-rw-rw-`). The `umask` modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The `umask` is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the `umask` are cleared in the resulting file mode.

`umask` can be set with either `octal` or `Symbolic` values:
- `Octal` (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie `umask 0027` or `umask 027`. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.
- `Symbolic` Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User `u`, group `g`, and world/other `o`. The permissions listed are not masked by `umask`. ie a `umask` set by `umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=` is the `Symbolic` equivalent of the `Octal` `umask 027`. This `umask` would set a newly created directory with file mode `drwxr-x---` and a newly created file with file mode `rw-r-----`.

The default `umask` can be set to use the `pam_umask` module or in a `System Wide Shell Configuration File`. The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions via the chmod command, or choosing a different default `umask` by adding the `umask` command into a `User Shell Configuration File`, ( `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`), in their home directory.

Setting the default umask:
- pam_umask module:
 - will set the umask according to the system default in `/etc/login.defs` and user settings, solving the problem of different `umask` settings with different shells, display managers, remote sessions etc.
 - `umask=<mask>` value in the `/etc/login.defs` file is interpreted as Octal
 - Setting `USERGROUPS_ENAB` to yes in `/etc/login.defs` (default):
 - will enable setting of the `umask` group bits to be the same as owner bits. (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the `uid` is the same as `gid`, and `username` is the same as the `<primary group name>`
 - userdel will remove the user's group if it contains no more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name of the user
- `System Wide Shell Configuration File`:
 - `/etc/profile` - used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells. The variables are sometimes the same ones that are in the `.bash_profile`, however this file is used to set an initial PATH or PS1 for all shell users of the system. **is only executed for interactive *login* shells, or shells executed with the --login parameter.** 
 - `/etc/profile.d` - `/etc/profile` will execute the scripts within `/etc/profile.d/*.sh`. It is recommended to place your configuration in a shell script within `/etc/profile.d` to set your own system wide environmental variables.
 - `/etc/bashrc` - System wide version of `.bashrc`. In Fedora derived distributions, `etc/bashrc` also invokes /etc/profile.d/*.sh if *non-login* shell, but redirects output to `/dev/null` if *non-interactive.* **Is only executed for *interactive* shells or if `BASH_ENV` is set to `/etc/bashrc`.**

User Shell Configuration Files:
- `~/.bash_profile` - Is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt. **Is only read by login shells.**
- `~/.bashrc` - Is executed for interactive shells. **only read by a shell that's both interactive and non-login**",Setting a secure default value for `umask` ensures that users make a conscious choice about their file permissions. A permissive `umask` value could result in directories or files with excessive permissions that can be read and/or written to by unauthorized users.,,"Review /etc/bashrc, /etc/profile, and all files ending in *.sh in the /etc/profile.d/ directory and remove or edit all `umask` entries to follow local site policy. Any remaining entries should be: `umask 027`, `umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=` or more restrictive.

Configure `umask` in **one** of the following files:
- A file in the `/etc/profile.d/` directory ending in `.sh`
- `/etc/profile`
- `/etc/bashrc`

_Example:_
```
# vi /etc/profile.d/set_umask.sh

umask 027
```

Run the following command and remove or modify the `umask` of any returned files:
```
# grep -RPi '(^|^[^#]*)\s*umask\s+([0-7][0-7][01][0-7]\b|[0-7][0-7][0-7][0-6]\b|[0-7][01][0-7]\b|[0-7][0-7][0-6]\b|(u=[rwx]{0,3},)?(g=[rwx]{0,3},)?o=[rwx]+\b|(u=[rwx]{1,3},)?g=[^rx]{1,3}(,o=[rwx]{0,3})?\b)' /etc/login.defs /etc/profile* /etc/bashrc*

Follow one of the following methods to set the default user umask:

Edit `/etc/login.defs` and edit the `UMASK` and `USERGROUPS_ENAB` lines as follows:
```
UMASK 027

USERGROUPS_ENAB no
```

Edit the files `/etc/pam.d/password-auth` and `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` and add or edit the following:
```
session optional pam_umask.so
```

**OR** Configure umask in one of the following files:
- A file in the `/etc/profile.d/` directory ending in .sh
- `/etc/profile`
- `/etc/bashrc`

_Example: /etc/profile.d/set_umask.sh_
