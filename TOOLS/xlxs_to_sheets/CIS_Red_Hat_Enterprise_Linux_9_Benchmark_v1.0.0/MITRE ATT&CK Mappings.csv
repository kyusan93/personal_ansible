The two options `ClientAliveInterval` and `ClientAliveCountMax` control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from `man 5 sshd_config`:

- `ClientAliveInterval` Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.

- `ClientAliveCountMax` Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.
The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.",TA0001

5.6,5.6.5,"Level 1 - Server, Level 1 - Workstation","The user file-creation mode mask (`umask`) is use to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (`rwxrwxrwx`), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (`rw-rw-rw-`). The `umask` modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The `umask` is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the `umask` are cleared in the resulting file mode.

`umask` can be set with either `octal` or `Symbolic` values:
- `Octal` (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie `umask 0027` or `umask 027`. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.
- `Symbolic` Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User `u`, group `g`, and world/other `o`. The permissions listed are not masked by `umask`. ie a `umask` set by `umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=` is the `Symbolic` equivalent of the `Octal` `umask 027`. This `umask` would set a newly created directory with file mode `drwxr-x---` and a newly created file with file mode `rw-r-----`.

The default `umask` can be set to use the `pam_umask` module or in a `System Wide Shell Configuration File`. The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions via the chmod command, or choosing a different default `umask` by adding the `umask` command into a `User Shell Configuration File`, ( `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`), in their home directory.

Setting the default umask:
- pam_umask module:
 - will set the umask according to the system default in `/etc/login.defs` and user settings, solving the problem of different `umask` settings with different shells, display managers, remote sessions etc.
 - `umask=<mask>` value in the `/etc/login.defs` file is interpreted as Octal
 - Setting `USERGROUPS_ENAB` to yes in `/etc/login.defs` (default):
 - will enable setting of the `umask` group bits to be the same as owner bits. (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the `uid` is the same as `gid`, and `username` is the same as the `<primary group name>`
